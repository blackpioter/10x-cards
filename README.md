## Project Name

**10x-cards**

## Project Description

10x-cards is a web application designed to simplify the process of creating high-quality educational flashcards. Users can input a text (ranging from 1000 to 10000 characters) and let the AI automatically generate flashcards that adhere to specified character limits (up to 200 characters for the front and 500 for the back). Additionally, the application allows manual creation, editing, and evaluation of flashcards, ensuring that only the best content is retained. The system also integrates a spaced repetition algorithm to maximize learning efficiency.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Astro 5, React 19, TypeScript 5
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4, Shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, authentication)
- **AI Integration:** Utilizes services via Openrouter.ai for generating flashcards
- **Testing:** Vitest, React Testing Library for unit tests, Playwright for E2E tests
- **CI/CD & Hosting:** GitHub Actions and DigitalOcean (Docker-based deployment)

## Getting Started Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd 10x-cards
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Ensure you are using Node version specified in `.nvmrc` (Node 22.14.0):**
   ```bash
   nvm use
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Access the app at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by Astro).

## Available Scripts

- `dev` - Starts the development server with live reloading using Astro.
- `build` - Builds the production version of the app.
- `preview` - Serves the production build locally for previewing.
- `lint` - Runs ESLint to analyze code quality.
- `lint:fix` - Runs ESLint and automatically fixes fixable issues.
- `format` - Formats code using Prettier.
- `astro` - Utility command for Astro tasks.

## Project Scope

The project focuses on addressing the challenge of manually creating high-quality flashcards. Key functionalities include:

- **AI-Generated Flashcards:** Users input text and receive automatically generated flashcards adhering to character limits.
- **Manual Creation & Editing:** Users can create and edit flashcards manually with enforced limits (front: 200 characters, back: 500 characters).
- **Flashcard Evaluation:** Options to accept, reject, or regenerate flashcards, with the ability to save progress and resume later.
- **User Account Management:** Secure registration, login, password changes, and account deletion, ensuring data is safely stored and accessible only to the user.
- **Spaced Repetition Integration:** Flashcards are integrated with a spaced repetition system to enhance learning efficiency.
- **Statistical Tracking:** Tracks the number of flashcards generated by AI and those ultimately accepted by users.
- **Data Privacy:** Ensures compliance with GDPR and related data protection regulations.
