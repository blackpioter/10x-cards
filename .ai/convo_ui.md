1. Focus on intuitive navigation using elements such as a navigation bar, breadcrumbs, and a responsive menu to allow users to easily switch between modules.
2. Follow a module-first approach by applying best practices even though no specific guidelines have been provided yet.
3. Integrate JWT-based authentication, which will be implemented in a later stage.
4. Use React’s built-in state management with hooks and Context initially, with the possibility of adding Zustand in the future if needed.
5. Display critical errors inline, while showing non-critical errors and success messages as toast notifications.
6. Initially implement only pagination for the flashcards list; filtering and sorting will be considered for later development.

<matched_recommendations>
1. Design a central dashboard that combines modules for flashcard generation, listing, and detailed editing to facilitate seamless user interaction.
2. Utilize intuitive navigation elements (navigation bar, breadcrumbs, responsive menu) to improve the overall user flow.
3. Adopt a mobile-first, responsive design using Shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS while ensuring accessibility standards (WCAG AA or higher) are met.
4. Implement state management with React hooks and Context, with a view to integrating a more advanced solution like Zustand if necessary.
5. Ensure clear error handling by displaying critical errors inline and non-critical messages via toast notifications.
6. Plan for secure practices by incorporating JWT handling on the client side to work in tandem with the backend’s security measures.

The conversation established that the primary focus is on creating an intuitive user interface for the MVP. Key requirements include:
- Developing a central dashboard that integrates flashcard generation (using AI), flashcard listing (with pagination), and detailed flashcard editing.
- Defining clear user flows starting with a login/registration screen and transitioning to the dashboard where all main functionalities are accessible.
- Implementing intuitive navigation components such as a navigation bar, breadcrumbs, and a responsive menu to ensure smooth transitions between modules.
- Using React’s built-in state management via hooks and Context to synchronize data with the API, with room to adopt Zustand later if needed.
- Following a mobile-first approach and ensuring the UI is responsive and meets WCAG AA accessibility standards.
- Planning for future security integration with JWT-based authentication and client-side validation.
- Error handling is to be managed by displaying critical errors inline and using toast notifications for success and minor error messages.

<unresolved_issues>
1. Detailed requirements and design for future filtering and sorting functionalities in the flashcards list.
2. Specific implementation details for integrating JWT-based authentication within the UI.
3. Criteria and conditions for transitioning from React Context to Zustand for state management as the project evolves.
